# SwiftUIResponsiveDesign
Example layouts to accompany "[What SwiftUI Developers Can Learn From Responsive Web Design](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-swiftui-developers-can-learn-from-responsive-web-dan-wood-vhghc)"

Best built for macOS, so you can resize the window and watch the layouts adjust to the available size.
